  ## Contributions
  #### As the developer, I have created a employee tracker application using server.js routes to connect with the SQL database and print an interactive terminal using inquirer for users. This application can be run after proper package installation, and by accessing the application via VS code's intgrated terminal, using the 'node server' command.
